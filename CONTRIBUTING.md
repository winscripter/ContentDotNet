# Contribution
We value any kind of contribution. See the contribution types below. Even if there's a mistake in your
contribution, we'll still appreciate the effort and treat it with respect.

Before contributing, please make sure to:
- Never include information that you know is sensitive. Anyone will be able to see it on the Internet, even after editing the post.
- Contribute in English **only**.
- Be respectful and appropriate.

#### Bug report
Use this if you find an issue with ContentDotNet that you believe shouldn't happen (i.e. an exception,
typo, incorrect implementation, etc).

Feel free to create an issue post on the GitHub repo of type 'bug report'. Provide the code snippet that is
causing the problem, and optionally, attach the file that you're providing to ContentDotNet for decoding (if any).

#### Suggestion
Use this if you're proposing a new feature to ContentDotNet - whether it's support for a new format, new
abstraction, or a general suggestion, like adding new methods/classes.

There are two ways to propose a suggestion:
- Issue post only (of type Feature suggestion): We'll try to implement it ourselves. If it involves a new format, we'll try to study and implement it.
- Issue post and Pull Request: You propose and implement a new feature, and we can directly incorporate your code (by merging the Pull Request). Use this if you already have knowledge on implementing the feature being suggested and have time to do so. We'll make sure to credit you.

#### Documentation enhancement
Use this if you're proposing changes to the Documentation.

The steps are the same as 'Suggestion', except, the type of Issue post is Documentation.
