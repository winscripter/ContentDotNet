### General
[10x performance with SIMD in C#/.NET](https://xoofx.github.io/blog/2023/07/09/10x-performance-with-simd-in-csharp-dotnet/) - This article helped us make massive optimizations to ContentDotNet components

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) - Helped with general programming questions

[Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com) - Helped with general programming questions; knows more up-to-date resources out of the box

### H.264
[JM Reference Software](https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/JM) ([unofficial GitHub repo](https://github.com/shihuade/JM)) - Official H.264 implementation for research and verification purposes. Reading its source code helped us implement the CABAC entropy coding component
