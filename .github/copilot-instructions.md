# About ContentDotNet
This repository serves as a powerful multimedia framework for C# applications. The idea is to provide C# programs
using this framework access to decoding (or optionally, encoding) file formats, codecs, and protocols, including
but not limited to:
- H.264
- RTSP
- JPEG

# Rules
1. Do not include native dependencies (i.e. ffmpeg, OpenH264, or libx264)
2. All code must be written in C#
3. Use English language only
