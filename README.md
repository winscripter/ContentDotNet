ContentDotNet is a library for C# to create videos, audios, images and other multimedia. It allows reading them,
creating them, and otherwise inspecting or editing their contents. It provides a user-friendly API, as well as
extensive documentation and samples.

Powered by nothing but .NET 8.0, it allows processing multimedia content very quickly and under a memory efficient
manner, while also being compatible with NativeAOT, ReadyToRun, Mobile/Desktop, Web, and Embedded/IoT scenarios.

It is cross-platform and platform-independent, allowing ContentDotNet to run on a wide range of systems without
worrying about compatibility, while also making deployment easier.

## What's supported?
ContentDotNet yet supports H.264 for video codecs and MP4 for video formats. This is an alpha release and
the stable one is expected to have more codecs and formats supported. Adding your own
codecs and formats is straightforward and is documented.
